# the_grand_reserve_restaurant

A course project using Bootstrap. 
images created using AI

Draft one... some items I want to fix: 

1)  some images need to fit properly in their container
2)  the text under About us - refine the look
3)  the scroll of the links.. the headings are hidden behind the top navigation bar.
4)  the alert after form submission. instead of an alert, to add a pop up box which has the same styling.
